    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <h3>What happened?</h3>
    <p>
        Popular addon developers (including me, no flex ;)) were banned from now.sh by zeit.co. (big middle finger to
        Paulo, the 'customer success engineer' of zeit for not being helpfull at all).
        Anyways, we had to look for another solution.
    </p>
    <h3>The solution</h3>
    <p>
        I'm planning to migrate all of my addons to an IPFS solution (= something similar to P2P) to benefit from
        extended addon survivabilty.
        However, things went all sorts of wrong during testing and I have to say it's just not ready yet. The end of the
        addon competition is around the corner
        and a lot of users need their favorite addons to be able to relax during these COVID-19 times.
        That's why this webserver has been set up, as a temporary solution! Enjoy, and sorry for the relatively long
        wait.
    </p>
